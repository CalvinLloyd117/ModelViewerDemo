                <h1>Performance</h1>
                <p><b>Disclaimer:</b> Performance is the category That I have spend the least amount of time exploring.</p>
                <p>Performance is tough to judge here, unfortunately. Model-Viewer is built on the three.js library. As a result, Model-Viewer offers a comparable experience in terms of both fps and load times when compared to three.js in its raw form. Again,
                    it is hard to measure this besides in a purely visual manner.</p>
                <p>It goes without saying, more powerful and modern machines will have a distinct advantage when viewing any 3D model on the web. They are capable of a much (much) smoother experience in terms of loading and especially Frames-per-second (FPS)
                    counts. My gaming desktop for example, has no problems rendering these models, even in copious quantities. Over 150 models rendered on a single page at a time, and my desktop did not even flinch. Not even when throttling the CPU by
                    6x in Google Chrome.</p>
                <p>Interestingly, throttling the CPU had virutally no impact. What did have an impact however, was disabling <i>hardware acceleration</i> in my browser. HW Acceleration allows for an application to access special HW present in the machine
                    in order to better perform a task. In this case, by disabling HW acceleration in Chrome I took away the browsers ability to access my Graphics Card (GPU), and my FPS counts plummeted (but were still perfectly acceptable) as a result.
                    This shows without a doubt that Model-Viewer (and by extension three.js) render models on the GPU where applicable. This explains why CPU throttling had no impact.</p>
                <p>As a true test, I subjected this demo site to the two slowest devices that I could think of. The first was my Surface Pro 3. This site runs fine on that device, load times and FPS are both acceptable, and despite the slow nature of the
                    device, it performed fine when running Model-Viewer.</p>
                <p>The slowest device I own is my Samsung Galaxy Note 5 (2015) smartphone. Unfortunately, performance here suffered. While the models were still interactable, FPS and load times were noticably slower.</p>
                <p>A Samsung Galaxy S7, a Phone from 2016 was able to render the models easily on this demo site. I am not certain what the issue is with my phone, but other devices seem to have perfectly acceptable performance.</p>
                <p>With more time dedicated to performance, I would certainly like to explore the performance on 3D modeling on the web in greater detail.</p>

                <p>Model-Viewer has great browser support accross the board. In cases where a feature is not supported natively, it can be made compatible by including a <i>polyfill.</i></p>
                <p>In programming and web-development, a <b>polyfill</b> is code that implements a feature on a browser that does not natively support that feature. Polyfills can typically be included to a site with very negligible overhead. </p>
                <p>In addition to enabling older browsers to support Model-Viewer, polyfills can also be included to optimize performance, and ensure that all of Model-Viewers features are supported.</p>
