          <p>During my first several months as a research assistant for the Blackfoot Research Project, I was tasked with two primary goals. First, I was asked to explore means of supporting and displaying 3D scans of Blackfoot artifacts on the web. This was completely new for me at the time, and I had very little prior experience with 3D objects in general, let alone supporting them on websites. As a recent graduate with a bachelor’s degree in computer science, I was keen to tackle this new challenge.</p>
        <p>I started my search with the popular JavaScript library three.js. Three.js gave developers a lot of freedom in crafting and hosting web-based 3D objects. The issue with three.js was that it came with a lot of unnecessary features, and by extension, increased complexity. Firstly, I knew that we did not need to craft our 3D models declaratively, because we already had high quality scans. All we truly needed was a means of displaying those models on the web, and allowing users to interact with them. Secondly, each model that is rendered by three.js would require its own JavaScript code in order to render it. Because each artifact is different, we would potentially require hundreds (if not thousands) of lines of code in order to support each and every Blackfoot artifact. Additionally, each way these artifacts would be displayed would further increase the workload for rendering these artifacts. What took just shy of one-hundred lines of code to render a single artifact would need to be repeated upwards of thirty times. Finally, I knew that the desire to add additional artifacts to the collection was strong, and adding additional artifacts to the collection would mean that new code would have to be written in order to support the new artifacts. I knew there had to be an easier way. </p>
        <p>Early in my search for a better way to support models on the web, I discovered a web-component being developed by Google called Model-Viewer. Model-Viewer is a light-weight 3D modeling framework built on the three.js suite. This framework takes a lot of the backend workload out of the equation, allowing for self-contained models which do not require the same meticulous care that comes from using three.js, while including no performance penalties. I thoroughly tested the features of the web-component, and studied how it worked, and whether it would satisfy the needs of the Blackfoot Research Project. I soon established that it would, given that most of the features I tested worked perfectly, and due to the nature of the web component, it alleviated many of the issues that were prevalent with three.js in its base form. Practically every 3D modelling functionality I anticipated us needing was already included in Model-Viewer, including rotation, zooming, animation, hotspots and more. </p>
        <p>When I first discovered Model-Viewer, it was still in development, and I kept a close watch on the development repository to verify that bugs were indeed being fixed, and promised features were being added, like hotspots. In the time I dedicated to studying Model-Viewer, many improvements and features were added, and support for the platform is only improving. At the time of writing, this tool is still being actively developed by Google, and the 1.0 version of the platform has yet to be fully released.</p>

          <h1>What is Model-Viewer?</h1>
          <p>
            Model-Viewer is a light-weight 3D modeling framework built on the
            three.js suite. This framework takes alot of the backend workload
            out of the equation, allowing for self-contained models which do not
            require the same care and meticulous hassle that comes from using
            three.js.
          </p>
          <p>
            What took me nearly 100 lines of code in three.js to render a simple
            knife, can be done with ease in Model-Viewer. It is literally as
            easy as including the model-viewer tag and the src of a .gltf, or
            .glb model in order to achieve basic functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Practically every 3D modelling functionality that I think we could
            ever need from three.js is already included in Model-Viewer, but
            without the need for hard coding a back-end platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of Model-Viewer's functionality and features are sure to improve
            in the future. This web component is still in development, and
            during my time exploring it, there have been many improvements that
            I was able to witness firsthand and compare during my research. The
            component already works great, and it's only getting better!
          </p>
          <p>
            Model-Viewer also removes some of the three.js limitations (such as
            a hard cap on the number of scenes that can be rendered at a time)
            while incurring seemingly no additional performance cost.
          </p>
          <h1>User Experience</h1>
          <p>
            Model-Viewer includes some basic user experience functionality which
            will help users interact with 3D models on the web.
          </p>
          <h3>Auto-Rotate</h3>
          <p>
            Model-Viewer allows users to include the <i>auto-rotate</i> tag
            which slowly rotates the model.
          </p>
          <input
            type="radio"
            id="rotateOn"
            name="autorotate"
            value="on"
            checked
          />
          <label for="on">On</label><br />
          <input type="radio" id="rotateOff" name="autorotate" value="off" />
          <label for="off">Off</label><br />
          <h3>Interaction and <i>Wiggle</i></h3>
          <p>
            A <i><b>wiggle</b></i> prompt can be enabled which indicates to
            users that the model is 3D and can be interacted with. The time
            between the wiggle prompts can also be changed.
          </p>
          <input type="radio" id="wiggleOn" name="wiggle" value="on" checked />
          <label for="on">On</label><br />
          <input type="radio" id="wiggleOff" name="wiggle" value="off" />
          <label for="off">Off</label><br />
          <p>
            <b>Interaction Policies</b> can be set which prevent accidentally
            zooming into a model rather than scroll down the webpage. So long as
            the model is not in focus, accidental interaction can be avoided.
          </p>

          <h1>Dynamic Models</h1>
          <p>
            Models can be changed dynamically, using some basic
            Javascript/jQuery.
          </p>
          <input type="radio" id="knife" name="model" value="knife" checked />

          <label for="running">Moccasins</label><br />

          <h1>Model Exposure</h1>
          <p>
            Model-Viewer includes an exposure tag, which changes the "lighting"
            of the object. This tag accepts a value from 0-1 and can be used to
            fix certain washed out models.
          </p>
          <p>
            This tag however does not control the actual lighting of the image.
            Lighting within this framework can be changed through HDR
            enviornment-images.
          </p>
          <input
            type="radio"

          <h1>Shadows (Intensity and Softness)</h1>
          <p>
            Model-Viewer also gives control over basic shadow effects for
            models.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Shadow Intensity:</b> Controls the alpha of the shadow effects.
            Higher values result in darker shadows.
          </p>
          <input
            type="radio"

          <input type="radio" id="HIntensity" name="intensity" value="highIn" />
          <label for="HIntensity">High</label><br />
          <p>
            <b>Shadow Softness:</b> Controls the softness of the edge of the
            shadows.
          </p>
          <p><b>NOTE:</b> Softer shadows render more quickly.</p>
          <input

          <label for="hardS">Harder</label><br />
          <h1>Other Model-Viewer Attributes</h1>
          <p>
            There are many other attributes (tags) that Model-Viewer has which
            can be accessed using jQuery. While Model-Viewer does not
            specifically advertise this as a feature, it is something we can
            take advantage of, and leverage to our needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note:</b> Not all attribute tages can be changed using Javascript
            (such as Animations).
          </p>
